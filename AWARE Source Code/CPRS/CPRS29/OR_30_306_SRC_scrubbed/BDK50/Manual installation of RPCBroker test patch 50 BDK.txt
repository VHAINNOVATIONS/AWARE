The following are instructions for installing the current test version of the Delphi 2006 RPC Broker BDK: XWB1_1P50.  Many of these steps will be done automatically by Perforce after all of this has been proven to be correct on a couple of developer systems.

1.  In Delphi2006, select the menu Component|Install Packages.  Use REMOVE button to remove:

  - CPRS Custom Controls
  - CPRS Date components
  - VistA RPC Broker

2.  Close Delphi and do the following:

 - Delete MAIN\BDK47 directory
 - Create MAIN\BDK50 directory
 - Delete old "MAIN\programfiles-vista-bdk32-*" directories
 - Copy the XWB1_1P50T1.zip file to the MAIN\BDK50 directory

3.  Open the XWB1_1P50T1.zip file in the MAIN\BDK50 directory, and extract or copy the entire folder BDK32P50 to c:\program files\vista, at the same level as the existing BDK32 folder.

4.  From the c:\program files\vista\BDK32P50\bin directory, copy the following Delphi 2006 Broker packages to the MAIN\PACKAGES directory:

         XWB_D2006.DCP
         XWB_D2006.BPL
         XWB_R2006.DCP
         XWB_R2006.BPL 
 
5.  Delete the following Delphi 2006 Broker packages from the MAIN\PACKAGES directory:

         XWB_D10.DCP
         XWB_D10.BPL
         XWB_R10.DCP
         XWB_R10.BPL
         
6. Copy the following updated CPRS packages from the "To Packages.ZIP" to the MAIN\PACKAGES directory:
         
         ORCtrlLib2006.BPL/.DCP/.MAP
         ORDateLib2006.BPL/.DCP/.MAP
         Borland2006.BPL/.DCP/.MAP

7. Copy the following updated files from the "To CPRS-LIB.ZIP" to the MAIN\CPRS-Lib directory:

         all other ORCtrlLib2006.*
         all other ORDateLib2006.*

8.  Open Delphi 2006 and select the menu Tools|Options, then Environment Options|Delphi Options|Library-Win32.  

9.  In the Library Path click on the ellipsis (...) at the right end and insure that all paths to other instances of the Broker package are removed (or inactivated by adding _x to the end of them), then add:
    C:Program Files\Vista\BDK32P50\D2006
    C:Program Files\Vista\BDK32P50\Source

10.  In Browsing Path click on the ellipsis (...) at the right end and insure that all paths to other instances of the Broker are removed (or inactivated by adding _x to the end of them), then add C:Program Files\Vista\BDK32P50\Source.

11.  Once the new Library Paths have been entered, select the menu Component|Install Packages. Add, in this order, from the MAIN\PACKAGES directory:

  - XWB_D2006.bpl
  - Borland2006.bpl
  - VAShared2006.bpl
  - ORCtrlLib2006.bpl
  - ORDateLib2006.bpl
  - VA508Access2006.bpl
  - VA2006.bpl

12.  Shutdown Delphi then restart Delphi.
       
13.  The Delphi 2006 RPCBroker is now installed and ready for use.  Test your installation as follows:

   - Open the CPRSChart project.
   - Open file fNoteBD.pas.  The form should correctly display the CPRS date components without any error occurring.
   - Build the project.  Only the usual hints and warnings should appear, and no errors.
