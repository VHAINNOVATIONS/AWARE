
The following are instructions for installing the BDK32_P50T4 update for the RPC Broker BDK: XWB1_1P50.

This update has been provided to address the following problems:
 1. Fix some problems with CCOW when running multiple versions/instances of CPRS.
 2. Fix compatibility issues with the Mental Health and Vitals DLL's called from within CPRS.
 3. Fix the problem of creating a new Verify Code when previous code had expired.

If you haven't installed the initial version of XWB1_P50 patch, do so before proceeding with these steps, using the instructions found in:
..\cprs\main\BDK50\Perforce Installation of RPCBroker test patch 50 BDK.txt

1.  Synch up to Perforce ...\main\BDK50\ to get these instructions and the BDK32_P50T4.zip file.

2.  Unzip the BDK32_P50T4.zip file to C:\Package Files\Vista\

3.  This will create a new folder that has all the necessary files for this version of the Broker:
    C:\Package Files\Vista\BDK32_P50T4

4.  In Delphi2006, select the menu Component|Install Packages.  Use REMOVE button to remove:

5.  Open Delphi 2006 and select the menu Tools|Options, then Environment Options|Delphi Options|Library-Win32.  

6.  In the Library Path click on the ellipsis (...) at the right end and insure that all paths to other instances of the Broker package are removed (or inactivated by adding _x to the end of them), then add:
    C:Program Files\Vista\BDK32_P50T4\D2006
    C:Program Files\Vista\BDK32_P50T4\Source
 
7.  In Browsing Path click on the ellipsis (...) at the right end and insure that all paths to other instances of the Broker are removed (or inactivated by adding _x to the end of them), then add C:Program Files\Vista\BDK32_P50T4\Source.

8.  Close Delphi and synch to the MAIN branch.  The following will occur:

 - The following Delphi 2006 Broker packages will be updated to the MAIN\PACKAGES directory:

         XWB_D2006.DCP
         XWB_D2006.BPL
         XWB_R2006.DCP
         XWB_R2006.BPL         
       
 - The following CPRS packages will be updated in the MAIN\PACKAGES and MAIN\CPRS-Lib directories:

         Borland2006.*
         ORCtrlLib2006.*
         ORDateLib2006.*
         VA2006.*
         VA508Access2006.*
         VAShared2006.*

9.   Start Delphi.

10.  Select the menu Component|Install Packages. Add, in this order, from the MAIN\PACKAGES directory:

  - XWB_D2006.bpl
  - Borland2006.bpl
  - VAShared2006.bpl
  - ORCtrlLib2006.bpl
  - ORDateLib2006.bpl
  - VA508Access2006.bpl
  - VA2006.bpl
       
11.  The Delphi 2006 RPCBroker is now installed and ready for use.  Test your installation as follows:

   - Open the CPRSChart project.
   - Open file fNoteBD.pas.  The form should correctly display the CPRS date components without any error occurring.
   - Build the project.  Only the usual hints and warnings should appear, and no errors.
   - To further test this patch, make sure that CCOW is running and startup multiple instances of CPRS. These can be different versions of CPRS and a combination of running cprs.exe and directly from Delphi.  You should be able to log on to each instance without getting any errors.  
   - Test the Vitals DLL by running Vitals from the Coversheet.
   - Test the Mental Health DLL on the Notes Tab by running an appropriate Reminders Dialog.
   - Test the expired Verify code problem by expiring your Verify Code and run CPRS GUI to reset to a new Verify code.
