        substance orders, as well as their prescribable drug schedules,
        menu option Provider Incomplete Configuraiton Report
      - A report that will list those users who have a DETOX/MAINTENANCE 
        ID
      - A report that will list those providers who have either a space or 
        punctuation in their last name
      - A report that will list the Fee Basis and C & A providers who do 
        not have a DEA number
 These new reports are all contained in the menu option ePCS Data
