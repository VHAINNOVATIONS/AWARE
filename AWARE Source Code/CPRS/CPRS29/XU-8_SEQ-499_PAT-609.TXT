Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is in support of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) e-Prescribing of
 Controlled Substances (CS) (ePCS) using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
 
 The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User Interface 
 (GUI) v29 is an enhancement release with modifications for the Drug
 Enforcement Agency (DEA) electronic prescribing (ePCS) of controlled
 substances, Problem List changes for the use of SNOMED CT codes, and the
 display of Mental Health Treatment Coordinator information entered through
 the Primary Care Management Module. In addition to these enhancements,
 software changes are being made to correct several Patient Safety Issues
 (PSIs), Section 508 issues, and additional miscellaneous defect fixes.
 CPRS GUI v29 consists of several host files, an updated CPRS GUI and 
 several Help files, too many to list (which will be located in a single 
 directory name HELP):
 
 HDI_1_11.KID which contains the HDI*1*11 patch
 PSS_1_166.KID which contains the PSS*1*166 patch
 CPRSV29_PSO_PSD.KID which contains the PSO*7*391 and PSD*3*73 patches
 OR_GMPL_GMTS_XU_29.KID which contains the XU*8*609, GMPL*2*36, GMTS*27*86
 and OR*3*306 patches 
 CPRSChart.exe 
 OR_30_371.KID which contains the OR*3*371 patch
 PSO_7_426.KID which contains the PSO*7*426 patch
   
 The host files were created to simplify installation and control the 
 phased implementation of CPRS v29 at the Veterans Health Administration
 (VHA) facilities. To see the current status and target dates for
