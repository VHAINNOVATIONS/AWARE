Subject: CPRS v29

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User Interface 
 (GUI) v29 is an enhancement release with modifications for the Drug
 Enforcement Agency (DEA) electronic prescribing (ePCS) of controlled
 substances, Problem List changes for the use of SNOMED CT codes, and the
 display of Mental Health Treatment Coordinator information entered through
 the Primary Care Management Module. In addition to these enhancements,
 software changes are being made to correct several Patient Safety Issues
 (PSIs), Section 508 issues, and additional miscellaneous defect fixes.
  
 CPRS GUI v29 consists of several host files, an updated CPRS GUI and 
 several Help files, too many to list (which will be located in a single 
 directory name HELP):
 HDI_1_11.KID which contains the HDI*1*11 patch
 PSS_1_166.KID which contains the PSS*1*166 patch
 CPRSV29_PSO_PSD.KID which contains the PSO*7*391 and PSD*3*73 patches
 OR_GMPL_GMTS_XU_29.KID which contains the XU*8*609, GMPL*2*36, GMTS*2.7*86
                        and OR*3*306 patches 
 CPRSChart.exe 
 OR_30_371.KID which contains the OR*3*371 patch
 PSO_7_426.KID which contains the PSO*7*426 patch
  
 The host files were created to simplify installation and control the 
 phased implementation of CPRS v29 at the Veterans Health Administration
 (VHA) facilities. To see the current status and target dates for

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. No Remedy Ticket - MHTC for Same Button_Associate Provider 
  
    Problem:
    ========
    When the CPRS Workgroup reviewed the Primary Care button, it was
    decided that the Mental Health Treatment Coordinator and the Associate
    Provider should be on the button. But it was also felt that the
    location of the Associate Provider on the button could be confusing to
    providers and they might misinterpret what it meant.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Following the recommendation from the workgroup, the layout of the 
    information on the button was changed to be clearer, as follows:
    . Top line: Primary Care Team / Primary Care Provider / Associate
      Primary Care Provider (if assigned)
    . Second line (if patient is an inpatient): Inpatient Attending /
      Inpatient Provider
    . Third line: Mental Health Treatment Coordinator (if assigned)
  
 2. HD0000000069944 - Problem list - SC vs. NSC vs. Unknown
    
    Problem:
    ========
    There was an inconsistency between the designation of service
    connection and treatment factors on the Problems Tab and the signature
    dialogs. On the Problems tab, the user was presented with a single
    check box to indicate Yes or No. If left blank, CPRS interpreted the
    blank as a No. On the signature dialogs, however, the same information
    had two check boxes, one for Yes and one for No. If neither was
    checked, CPRS interpreted this as Unknown.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    CPRS developers changed the Problems tab so that it now has two check 
    boxes for Yes and No and the system will now accept a blank entry for 
    both as Unknown.
  
 3. HD0000000070892 - Details of Old Orders
  
    Problem:
    ========
    For orders prior to the install of the first CPRS GUI release, users
    are receiving a message "Detail view is not available for selected
    order".
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    CPRS developers corrected the problem.
  
 4. HD0000000266396 - ORWCH BOUNDS Question
  
    Problem:
    ========
    Some dialogs were not saving their position nor size in the ORWCH
    BOUNDS parameter as they should. Therefore, when changing the size of a
    dialog and then closing the session and reopening, the dialog returned
    to its default size.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    CPRS developers corrected the problem and the dialogs should 
    appropriately retain their size from session to session in CPRS.
  
 5. HD0000000276744 - Quick Order Quantity Quandary with Decimal Point
  
    Problem:
    ========
    When the user entered a quick order with a fractional value and 
    Auto-verify was set to YES, CPRS gave an Invalid Integer Error.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    CPRS developers corrected this problem and fractional values can be 
    entered.
  
 6. HD0000000278019 - Free-Text Dosage Display in Patient Instructions/SIG
  
    Problem:
    ========
    When a provider entered a free-text dosage rather than picking one from
    the drop-down list, the text displayed in the Patient Instructions/SIG
    and order details in CPRS. It was assumed that this might be dangerous
    as the patients could misunderstand the dose they were to
    take-especially if the dosage contained a concentration for a
    medication such as insulin.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Corrected the display.
  
 7. HD0000000325209 - Cannot Do Chart Check on DC'd Entered in Error Orders
  
    Problem:
    ======== 
    CPRS would allow verification of discontinued orders, but it did not
    allow 24-hour chart check.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    CPRS developers corrected this problem.
  
 8. HD0000000328643 - Rx Patient Status Field Works Erratically
  
    Problem:
    ========
    Outpatient prescription fields do not display consistently in CPRS.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    CPRS developers made some corrections to the file to make it function 
    correctly.
  
 9. HD0000000334617 - Attempting to Copy to a New Order Resulting in a GUI 
                      Error
  
    Problem:
    ========
    When attempting an action on an order with more than 9 actions, the 
    user would get an error that read, "NUMBER' is not a valid integer"
    (where NUMBER was something like 12621991).
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    CPRS developers corrected the problem.
  
 10. HD0000000360890 - Problem in CPRS causing error in Lab
  
     Problem:
     ========
     Error in Lab which originates with an issue with Lab urgency in CPRS.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     CPRS developers corrected this problem.
  
 11. HD0000000385673 - Complex Dose Different than Single Dose
  
     Problem:
     ========
     The dosage for a simple versus complex order for the same medication 
     could result in getting a different dosage. For example, the simple
     dose might be a 40 mg tablet, which the complex might use an 80 mg
     tablet and use half-tablets for part of the complex dose.
    
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Developers corrected this problem. If the single tablet is better,
     that dose will be used.
  
 12. HD0000000396719 - Error Local Dosage Field Translation 
  
     Problem:
     ========
     The translation for local dosages was not working correctly. 
    
     Resolution:
     ===========
     CPRS developers changed the translation so that instead of 1.2 being 
     put in the instructions as "1.2 tablets", it will now read "one and .2
     tablets". This is the correct translation.
  
 13. HD0000000417043 - Cytopathology report that printed with the wrong
                       Veteran's name in the header
  
     Problem:
     ========
     If the user was on a patient's record and had viewed a report and then
     processed an alert for a different veteran's results and then tried to
     print the Most Recent report, CPRS printed the report incorrectly. The
     information was for the second patient while the header was for the
     first patient.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Printing from the Most Recent display was disabled. It should not have
     been allowed.
  
  
  
 14. HD0000000429709 - Double-Clicking an Order via the Order Menu Will
                       Create Two Order Dialogs
  
     Problem:
     ========
     Rapidly double-clicking on an order menu item could bring up multiple
     dialogs. In the reported case, double-clicking on an inpatient
     medications item instead brought up two outpatient medication dialogs.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     CPRS developers corrected this problem.
  
 15. HD0000000437940 - Wrong Location Dialog Box Displays when a Provider 
                       Tries to Renew
  
     Problem:
     ========
     When a provider tries to sign the renewal orders sent from
     AudioRenewal, they get print location box.  They should get Provider &
     Location for Current Activities.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========  
     CPRS developers corrected this problem. The correct dialog now
     displays.
  
 16. HD0000000444275  - User Is Being Prompted to Sign DC'd Order that Was 
                        Cancelled 
  
     Problem:
     ========
     Previously, cancelling orders caused problems with both order checks
     and the signature dialog.
  
     Resolution:
     =========== 
     CPRS developers corrected this problem. If you cancel an order on the 
     signature dialog the order checks will update and the order will no 
     longer display again to be signed on the signature dialog after it has
     been cancelled.
  
 17. HD0000000478780 - Cannot Focus a Disabled or Invisible Window Error
                       Msg Appears when Clicking on an Appt on the Cover
                       Sheet
  
     Problem:
     ========
     Cannot Focus a Disabled or Invisible Window Error Msg Appears when 
     Clicking on an Appt on the Cover Sheet
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     CPRS developers corrected this problem.
  
 18. HD0000000483700 - Force CPRS to Always Use MH DLL to Resolve Reminders
  
     Problem:
     ========
     The Mental Health team requested that CPRS be changed to always use
     the new Mental Health dll when resolving a mental-health related
     reminder.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     CPRS developers now force reminders to use the Mental Health DLL to 
     resolve reminders. If the MH DLL is not available, CPRS will not
     proceed.
  
 19. HD0000000486375 - RDI Currently Uses a Truncated, 10-Digit Version of
                       the ICN in Its Calls to HDR
   
     Problem:
     ========
     RDI Currently Uses a Truncated, 10-Digit Version of the ICN in Its
     Calls to HDR
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     CPRS developers changed Remote Data Interoperability to use the full 
     identifier rather than a truncated one.
  
 20. HD0000000486635 - Note Label Disappearing
  
     Problem:
     ========
     The line that displays how many notes have been entered for the
     patient disappeared when the user selected the New Note button.
   
     Resolution:
     ===========
     CPRS developers corrected this problem. The number of notes for the 
     patient will display above the Notes tree view display.
  
 21. HD0000000486696 - Cannot Edit Notes for Reminder Dialogs
  
     Problem:
     ========
     Users were unable to edit notes for reminder dialogs using the
     template editor. When importing a Clinical Reminder Dialog Template
     into Shared Templates the Show Template Notes did not display.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     CPRS developers corrected this problem.
  
 22. HD0000000499883 - Free-Text Results "Collide" When Graphing 
                       Multiple Lab Tests
  
     Problem:
     ========
     Under a specific set of circumstances, it was possible for the lab 
     test free-text result from one lab test to incorrectly be displayed as
     the result in another test. The following conditions were necessary to
     produce this error: 
     . Multiple lab tests must be selected.
     . At least two of these lab tests must have values that are free-text.
     . The values must be different. 
     . The graphs must be separate (Individual Graphs checked). 
     . One of the lab tests with a free-text value must be the very top
       item in the Items list.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Developers corrected this issue. The entries should now read   
     correctly.
  
  
 23.  HD0000000516561 - Another Person Editing Orders
  
      Problem:
      ========
      In CPRS 28, when a user entered an allergy from the Orders tab, 
      CPRS locked ordering for the selected patient until the entire CPRS 
      session was closed-even if the user changed patients in the original
      session, the lock remained until the session was completely closed. A
      user in a different session could not order anything on the locked
      patient until the first session was closed. This problem did not
      occur if the allergy was entered from the Cover Sheet, only from the
      Orders tab.
  
      Resolution:
      ===========
      CPRS developers corrected this problem. The lock should be 
      released as soon as the provider is done placing orders, including 
      allergies, on the Orders tab.
  
 24. HD0000000581482 -  Allergy Issue - Observed entries set to 
                        default value MODERATE
  
     Problem:
     ========
     CPRS Observed allergies defaulted to the Severity of Moderate. Because
     users could accept the default without making a conscious decision
     about severity, there could be a potential risk of using a medication
     that is listed with an existing Adverse Reaction (ADR)/Allergy, but
     with an unexpected level of reaction. This could delay treatment of
     lifesaving medication because the severity is rated higher than it
     should be, or it could cause the clinician to give a medication that
     causes a severe reaction when only a moderate reaction was expected.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Developers changed the default for all observed ADR/Allergy entries to
     be BLANK (NULL), and CPRS now requires the user to select an ADR
     severity (Mild/Moderate/Severe).
