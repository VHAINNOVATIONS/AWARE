Subject: CPRS GUI 29 FOLLOW-UP PATCH

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is a follow-up patch to CPRS GUI Version 29.  It should be 
 installed just after the bundle including patch OR*3.0*306 is installed.
  
 Below are the issues resolved in this patch:
  
 1) The word "dispensing" was spelled wrong in the parameter OR DEA TEXT 
 which is used to display on the signature dialog when signing controlled 
 substance orders. The post install of this patch corrects that spelling.
  
 2) There were sporadic instances of the "Failed to Find Hash" error in 
 backdoor Pharmacy when finishing controlled substance orders. This was 
 caused by duplicate entries being created in the ORDER DEA ARCHIVE 
 INFO (#101.52) for these orders. This patch catches these duplicates
 before they happen so that the order can be finished without issue.
  
 3) There was an error being generated in IN^ORCMED upon installation of 
 OR*3.0*306. This patch fixes this error.
  
 4) This patch turns on auditing for the ORDER DEA ARCHIVE INFO 
 (#101.52). This is a requirement from the Drug Enforcement Agency for 
 electronically written controlled substance prescriptions.
  
 5) Routine ORDEA02 is used by the new menu option ePCS Controlled Subs by 
 Provider [OR EPCS CS RX BY PROVIDER]. This patch distributes that routine.
  
 6) Resolves a server-side error reported in Remedy Ticket 840933:
  
 <UNDEFINED>SETNARR+2^ORWPCE3,
  
 which was reported initially by Heartland West, and later by Heartland
 East. The error occurs when a user has written a progress note and
 attempts enter Encounter data. If a diagnosis for which the text begins 
 with a number (e.g., 2ND DEGREE BURN) is selected from the Encounter form
 in CPRS, and the Encounter data is filed, the error appears when focus
 returns to the Notes tab. The error does not cause the CPRS session to
 disconnect, and the Encounter data is successfully transmitted to PCE.
 However, subsequent attempts to access the note will result in the
 recurrence of the error, when CPRS tries to fetch the Encounter data to
 present in the pane at the bottom of the Notes tab.
