 Coordinator (MHTC) information entered through the Primary Care Management
 Module. In addition to these enhancements, software changes are being made
 to correct several PSIs, Section 508 issues, and additional miscellaneous
 defect fixes.

 this bulletin will be delivered to the OR CACS Mail Group. It may be 
 configured to be delivered to separate local mail groups for each Medical 
 Center Division by setting the new OR PROBLEM NTRT BY DIVISION parameter.

 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.29 Installation Guide" for 
 installation and set-up information.  This document is exported 
 as OR_30_306_IG.doc and OR_30_306_IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_306.ZIP.
  
 Installation of these host files must be coordinated among the personnel 
 affected because these host files will be installed in one installation 
 session.
  
 The following issue has been fixed in this patch (PSO*7*426):
  
 Hines reported that when finishing a complex pending order if 'month' is
 part of duration then the order is discontinued due to hash mismatch. This
 is due to pharmacy storing 'month' as "L" and CPRS storing as "M". This
 patch resolves this problem by tweaking the hash check code to represent
 "L" as "M" when "L" is found in the duration field.
