 as OR_30_306_IG.doc and OR_30_306_IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_306.ZIP.
  
 Installation of these host files must be coordinated among the personnel 
 affected because these host files will be installed in one installation 
 session.
  
  
 This is the Pharmacy Data Management patch (PSS*1*166) that provides
 the following enhancements and will be in the KIDS distribution PSS_1_166.
  
 1. This patch modifies Integration Control Registration (ICR) #3737 by
    adding the following two new Application Programming Interfaces (API):
    a. The API $$DETOX^PSSOPKI will return a "1" (one) if the drug name 
       contains "BUPREN", a detoxification drug or a "0" (zero) otherwise.
  
    b. The API $$OIDETOX^PSSOPKI is provided to CPRS to determine
       whether an orderable item has an associated detoxification drug.
  
 2. This patch modifies ICR #3784 - API $$IVDEA^PSSUTIL1 to return the 
    specific CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) code of the VA PRODUCT file
    (#50.68) or the specific DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) code of the DRUG
    file (#50) of the drugs tied to the Orderable Item.
  
 3. Patch PSS*1*159 introduced an issue where the user was prevented from
    up-arrowing (^) to quit out of the template in the Edit Orderable Items
    [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] and Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance
    [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE ITEMS] options. This patch resolves that issue
    by allowing the user to up-arrow out of the template.
