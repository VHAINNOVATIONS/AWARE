Subject: Problem List Data Standardization of Health Summary

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User Interface
 (GUI) v29 is an enhancement release with modifications for the Drug
 Enforcement Agency (DEA) electronic prescribing (ePCS) of controlled
 substances, Problem List changes for the use of SNOMED CT codes, and the
 display of Mental Health Treatment Coordinator information entered through
 the Primary Care Management Module. In addition to these enhancements,
 software changes are being made to correct several Patient Safety Issues
 (PSIs), Section 508 issues, and additional miscellaneous defect fixes.
  
 CPRS GUI v29 consists of several host files, an updated CPRS GUI and 
 several Help files, too many to list (which will be located in a single
 directory name HELP):
 HDI_1_11.KID which contains the HDI*1*11 patch
 PSS_1_166.KID which contains the PSS*1*166 patch
 CPRSV29_PSO_PSD.KID which contains the PSO*7*391 and PSD*3*73 patches
 OR_GMPL_GMTS_XU_29.KID which contains the XU*8*609, GMPL*2*36, GMTS*2.7*86
 and OR*3*306 patches 
 CPRSChart.exe 
 OR_30_371.KID which contains the OR*3*371 patch
 PSO_7_426.KID which contains the PSO*7*426 patch
  
 The host files were created to simplify installation and control the 
 phased implementation of CPRS v29 at the Veterans Health Administration
 (VHA) facilities. To see the current status and target dates for
 Sites/VISN/Regions please refer to the following site:
  
 http://vaww.oed.portal.va.gov/projects/CPRS/v29_main/Public/Forms/AllItems
 .aspx
  
 Click on the CPRS GUI v29 Deployment Schedule folder. Then open the
 document "CPRS GUI v29 Deployment Schedule.xslx".
  
 Patch Information:
 ==================
 HDI*1*11 supports CPRS v29 functionality by adding data for the Problem
 List Domain to the HDIS DOMAIN file (#7115.1).
  
 PSS*1*166, PSD*3*73 and PSO*7*391 support the DEA ePCS functionality.
  
 GMPL*2*36 is an extension to accommodate SNOMED-CT
 GMTS*2.7*86 supports the Problem List Standardization
 XU*8*609 ePCS Support
 OR*3*306 New CPRS version 29 which contains several Remedy ticket fixes 
 and enhanced the Primary Care button by adding the Mental Health 
 Treatment Coordinator and the Associate Provider. Adds a new Bulletin 
 "OR PROBLEM NTRT BULLETIN" and reissues Mail Group OR CACS. By default, 
 this bulletin will be delivered to the OR CACS Mail Group. It may be 
 configured to be delivered to separate local mail groups for each Medical 
 Center Division by setting the new OR PROBLEM NTRT BY DIVISION parameter. 
 The bulletin informs its recipients that a new NTRT Request has been 
 initiated by a Clinician at their facility.
  
 OR*3*371 includes support for CPRS v29 - ePCS and encounters.
  
 PSO*7*426 ePCS Support
  
 This patch (GMTS*2.7*86) contains changes to the PROBLEM LIST ALL (PLL),
 PROBLEM LIST ACTIVE (PLA), and PROBLEM LIST INACTIVE (PLI) components of
 the Health Summary (HS) Adhoc Report in support of the Problem List Data
 Standardization project. These changes will impact the HS application in
 both the List Manager and the CPRS GUI v29 and onwards.
  
 New problems that are added from the Problem List Dataset/Subset of the
 Lexicon look-up will now display both the SNOMED-CT (SCT) code and the
 mapped ICD-9-CM code(s) in all three of the components mentioned above.
 Problems that are mapped to multiple ICD-9-CM codes will display the 
 primary ICD-9-CM code first followed by the secondary ICD-9-CM codes
 delimited with "/". Pre-existing legacy problems and problems entered 
 from the Encounters form with only ICD-9-CM codes will continue to 
 display the ICD-9-CM codes.
  
 The following is a sample HS Adhoc Report:

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.med.va.gov/. This transmits the files from the first
 available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly
 from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
  Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
  Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at:  http://www4.va.gov/vdl/

 Software Retrieval and Installation Instructions:
 =================================================
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.29 Installation Guide" for installation
 and set-up information. This document is exported as OR_30_306_IG.doc and
 OR_30_306_IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_306.ZIP
  
 Installation of these host files must be coordinated among the personnel
 affected because these host files will be installed in one installation
 session.
  
 Sites will retrieve VistA software from an FTP address as directed by the
 CPRS Implementation team. Installation instructions will be distributed
 when your site begins the implementation process.
