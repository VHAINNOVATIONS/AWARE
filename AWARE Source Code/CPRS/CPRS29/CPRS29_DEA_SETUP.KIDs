The e-Prescribing of Controlled Substances (ePCS) project, which is 
"BLD",8639,1,2,0)
scheduled to be released later this year, will provide enhanced 
"BLD",8639,1,3,0)
functionality to allow for the electronic prescribing of controlled
"BLD",8639,1,4,0)
substances while meeting Drug Enforcement Administration's regulations and
"BLD",8639,1,5,0)
requirements.
"BLD",8639,1,6,0)
 
"BLD",8639,1,7,0)
In preparation for this project, new security key PSDRPH is being added 
"BLD",8639,1,8,0)
in this patch. This key authorizes pharmacists to finish/verify digitally
"BLD",8639,1,9,0)
signed Schedule II-V Controlled Substance (CS) orders placed via
"BLD",8639,1,10,0)
COMPUTERIZED PATIENT RECORD SYSTEM (CPRS) V. 3.0. It should be assigned
"BLD",8639,1,11,0)
only to registered pharmacists working with Schedule II-V drugs.
"BLD",8639,1,12,0)
 
"BLD",8639,1,13,0)
The assignment of security key PSDRPH may be done at any time after the 
"BLD",8639,1,14,0)
release of this patch to begin the setup process required for ePCS.

The e-Prescribing of Controlled Substances (ePCS) project, which is 
"PKG",276,22,1,"PAH",1,1,2,0)
scheduled to be released later this year, will provide enhanced 
"PKG",276,22,1,"PAH",1,1,3,0)
functionality to allow for the electronic prescribing of controlled
"PKG",276,22,1,"PAH",1,1,4,0)
substances while meeting Drug Enforcement Administration's regulations and

In preparation for this project, new security key PSDRPH is being added 
"PKG",276,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
in this patch. This key authorizes pharmacists to finish/verify digitally
"PKG",276,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
signed Schedule II-V Controlled Substance (CS) orders placed via
"PKG",276,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
COMPUTERIZED PATIENT RECORD SYSTEM (CPRS) V. 3.0. It should be assigned
"PKG",276,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
only to registered pharmacists working with Schedule II-V drugs.
"PKG",276,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
 
"PKG",276,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
The assignment of security key PSDRPH may be done at any time after the 
"PKG",276,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
release of this patch to begin the setup process required for ePCS.
