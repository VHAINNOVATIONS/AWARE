Description:
============

 The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User Interface 
 (GUI) v29 is an enhancement release with modifications for the Drug
 Enforcement Agency (DEA) electronic prescribing (ePCS) of controlled
 substances, Problem List changes for the use of SNOMED CT codes, and the
 display of Mental Health Treatment Coordinator information entered through
 the Primary Care Management Module. In addition to these enhancements,
 software changes are being made to correct several Patient Safety Issues
 (PSIs), Section 508 issues, and additional miscellaneous defect fixes.
  
 CPRS GUI v29 consists of several host files, an updated CPRS GUI and 
 several Help files, too many to list (which will be located in a single
 directory name HELP): 
 HDI_1_11.KID which contains the HDI*1*11 patch
 PSS_1_166.KID which contains the PSS*1*166 patch 
 CPRSV29_PSO_PSD.KID which contains the PSO*7*391 and PSD*3*73 patches
 OR_GMPL_GMTS_XU_29.KID which contains the XU*8*609, GMPL*2*36, GMTS*2.7*86
 and OR*3*306 patches 
 CPRSChart.exe 
 OR_30_371.KID which contains the OR*3*371 PATCH
 PSO_7_426.KID which contains the PSO*7*426 patch
  
 The host files were created to simplify installation and control the 
 phased implementation of CPRS v29 at the Veterans Health Administration
 (VHA) facilities. To see the current status and target dates for
 Sites/VISN/Regions please refer to the following site:

 Patch Information:
 ==================
 HDI*1*11 supports CPRS v29 functionality by adding data for the Problem
 List Domain to the HDIS DOMAIN file (#7115.1).
  
 PSS*1*166, PSD*3*73 and PSO*7*391 support the DEA ePCS functionality.
  
 GMPL*2*36 is an extension to accommodate SNOMED-CT
 GMTS*2.7*86 supports the Problem List Standardization
 XU*8*609 ePCS Support
 OR*3*306 New CPRS version 29 which contains several Remedy ticket fixes 
 and enhanced the Primary Care button by adding the Mental Health 
 Treatment Coordinator and the Associate Provider. Adds a new Bulletin 
 "OR PROBLEM NTRT BULLETIN" and reissues Mail Group OR CACS. By default, 
 this bulletin will be delivered to the OR CACS Mail Group. It may be 
 configured to be delivered to separate local mail groups for each Medical 
 Center Division by setting the new OR PROBLEM NTRT BY DIVISION parameter. 
 The bulletin informs its recipients that a new NTRT Request has been 
 initiated by a Clinician at their facility.
  
 OR*3*371 includes support for CPRS v29 - ePCS and encounters.
  
 PSO*7*426 ePCS Support
  
 The purpose of this patch (GMPL*2*36) is to accommodate the use of the
 Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) for
 selection of Patient Problems, and to dovetail with the efforts of
 Standard Data Service (SDS) to implement SNOMED CT on both the Enterprise
 Terminology Server and the Clinical Lexicon, using the New Term Rapid
 Turnaround (NTRT) strategy for vetting and deployment of novel clinical
 expressions.
  
 This patch introduces changes required by CPRS GUI v29 for selection of
 Patient Problems using SNOMED CT.

 GMPL PROBLEM NTRT BULLETIN    (New)
 This bulletin is sent to members of the FORUM mail group g.PROBLEM LIST 
 NTRT when a SNOMED CT Concept is selected by the user for which no 
 ICD-9-CM codes are mapped. The mail group is populated with members of 
 OI&T's Standards and Terminology Service. When approved by the Domain 
 Steward for Problem List, new standardized mappings will be deployed 
 using the New Term Rapid Turnaround capability.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.med.va.gov/. This transmits the files from the first
 available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly
 from a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
 Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
 Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
