Description:
============

 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) v29 is an enhancement release 
 with modifications for the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) electronic
 prescribing (ePCS) of controlled substances, Problem List changes for the
 use of SNOMED CT codes, and the display of Mental Health Treatment
 Coordinator (MHTC) information entered through the Primary Care Management
 Module. In addition to these enhancements, software changes are being made
 to correct several PSIs, Section 508 issues, and additional miscellaneous
 defect fixes.
  
 CPRS GUI version 29 consists of several host files, updated CPRS GUI and 
 several Help files; too many to list (which will be located in a single 
 directory named HELP):
 HDI_1_11.KID           CONTAINS HDI*1*11 PATCH 
 PSS_1_166.KID          CONTAINS PSS*1*166 PATCH
 CPRSV29_PSO_PSD.KID    CONTAINS PSO*7*391 AND PSD*3*73 PATCHES
 OR_GMPL_GMTS_XU_29.KID CONTAINS XU*8*609, GMPL*2*36, GMTS*2.7*86 AND 
                                 OR*3.0*306 PATCHES
 CPRSChart.exe
 OR_30_371.KID          CONTAINS OR*3.0*371 PATCH
 PSO_7_426.KID          CONTAINS PSO*7*426 PATCH
  
 The host files were created to simplify installation and also to control
 the phased implementation of CPRS V29 at the Veterans Health
 Administration (VHA) facilities. To see the current status and
 target dates for Sites/VISN/Regions, please refer to the following site:
  
 http://go.usa.gov/TfvW
  
 Then open the document "CPRS GUI v29 Deployment Schedule.xslx".
  
 Patch information:
 HDI_1_11 supports CPRS v29 functionality by adding data for the Problem
 List Domain to the HDIS DOMAIN file (#7115.1).
  
 PSS*1*166, PSO*7*391, PSD*3*73 and PSO*7*426 supports the DEA ePCS
 functionality.
  
 GMPL*2*36 is an extension to accommodate SNOMED-CT.
 GMTS*2.7*86 supports the Problem List Standardization.
 XU*8*609 ePCS Support
 OR*3*306 New CPRS version 29 which contains several Remedy ticket fixes 
 and enhances the Primary Care button by adding the Mental Health 
 Treatment Coordinator and the Associate Provider. Adds a new Bulletin 
 "OR PROBLEM NTRT BULLETIN" and reissues Mail Group OR CACS. By default, 
 this bulletin will be delivered to the OR CACS Mail Group. It may be 
 configured to be delivered to separate local mail groups for each Medical 
 Center Division by setting the new OR PROBLEM NTRT BY DIVISION parameter. 
  
 OR_30_371 includes support for CPRS v.29.
  
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.29 Installation Guide" for 
 installation and set-up information.  This document is exported 
 as OR_30_306_IG.doc and OR_30_306_IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_306.ZIP.
  
 Installation of these host files must be coordinated among the personnel 
 affected because these host files will be installed in one installation 
 session.
  
 Note:
    A new security key named "PSDRPH", has been sent out in the Controlled
    Substances patch PSD*3*76, which is a required patch for this patch 
    (PSO*7*391).
    This key authorizes pharmacists to finish/verify digitally signed
    Schedule II-V CS orders placed via CPRS and should be assigned to
    registered pharmacists working with Schedule II-V drugs.
  
 The following modifications and enhancements are included in this patch 
 (PSO*7*391):
  
 1. When processing a digitally signed pending order, the integrity of the 
 original order placed in CPRS is now being checked to ensure that the data
 fields listed below are not altered from the time the order is signed in
 CPRS and later selected for processing in backdoor pharmacy. This is done
 by passing the data elements listed below to a Kernel Application
 Programming Interface (API), Integration Control Registration (ICR) #3539,
 along with the CPRS hash count, provided by ICR #5709. The Kernel API
 compares these two hash values and returns an "OK" if the pending order is
 unaltered or otherwise, returns a "-1^error code^error message."
  
 Example: "-1^89802016^Mismatched digital signature hash values."
  
 These are the fields used in the hash check:
         Date of Issuance
         Full Name and Address of the Patient
         Drug Name
         Quantity Prescribed  
         Directions for Use
         Prescriber Name   
         Prescriber Address (site address) 
         Prescriber DEA / VA Registration Number
         Order Number (CPRS)
  
 The Kernel API will also check for the validity of the DEA certificate. If
 the certificate is revoked or expired then the API will return the
 appropriate error code.
 If the error code is related to hash mismatch or the DEA certificate is
 revoked then the following events will be triggered during pending order
 processing:
   The order will be auto discontinued.
   First line of the pending order screen will have the message "Digital
   Signature Failed: Corrupted (Hash mismatch)" or "Certificate revoked"
   concatenated with "Order Auto Discontinued", and the message will be
   highlighted in reverse video.
   The status bar of the screen will have the message "Signature Failed: 
   Corrupted (Hash mismatch)" or "Certificate revoked."
   A mail message will be generated to the holders of the PSDMGR key 
   notifying that the order has been auto discontinued (similar to the 
   example listed below).
   If the discontinuation is due to a hash mismatch as a result of altering
   one of the fields listed above then the mail message will show the
   altered fields with the discrepancies. Here is an example:
  
   Subj: DIGITALLY SIGNED NEW ORDER AUTO DISCONTINUED  [#196353] 
         03/20/12@17:1024 lines
   From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*

   Differences in CPRS and Pharmacy Pending File
  
   Data Name           CPRS File         Pharmacy Pending File

   QTY PRESCRIBED      15                30
  
          
   If the error code is related to 'certificate expired', the pending 
   order will be processed (will not be auto discontinued) and a 
   notification will be sent to the provider with the message, "DEA
   certificate expired. Renew your certificate."
  
 2. When finishing a pending CS order, if the user does not hold the new 
    PSDRPH security key, the order will be marked as 'Non-Verified'.
  
 3. To verify a 'Non-Verified' CS order, PSDRPH security key is now
    required.
  
 4. To discontinue a pending CS order, PSDRPH security key is now required.
  
 5. The pending order screen will now display the provider's DEA/VA #, the 
    DETOX# (if available) and the site address.
  
 6. When finishing a new pending CS order, the orderable item, dosage, 
    provider name, or the number of refills will not be allowed to be 
    edited. Also, if the changes to the dispense drug would result in
    a new order being created, this will not be allowed for digitally 
    signed orders. The user WILL be allowed to select other dispense drugs 
    for the same Orderable Item as long as it does not change the 
    prescribed dosage.
  
 7. When finishing a new pending CS order, the days supply or the quantity
    will not be allowed to increase, but can be decreased. If the days
    supply is decreased, the number of refills will also be adjusted 
    accordingly depending on the drug setup (maximum refills, not 
    refillable etc). (The quantity may be auto-calculated to a higher 
    quantity by the system only when the dosage remains the same, but the 
    dispense drug strength is changed - i.e. 2mg tablets #30 is changed to 
    1mg tablets, the Sig is updated and the system changes the quantity to 
    60. A manual change to a higher quantity is not allowed.)
  
  
 8. In patch PSO*7*99, a change was made for pending orders not to 
    recalculate the quantity for CS drugs on selecting a different strength
    of the same drug and resulting in the same prescribed dosage. This
    change is removed in this patch.
  
 9. When finishing a pending CS order or verifying a CS order by the PSDRPH
    key holder, any edit to some of the key fields like dispense drug,
    dosage, dispense units, issue date, day's supply, quantity or number of
    refills, will now be captured and stored in the activity log.
  
 10. In the Complete Orders From OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, a new sort 
     selection, 'CS' is included to select digitally signed CS orders 
     separately.
  
 11. A new field BACKDOOR SIGNATURE STATUS (#311) is being added to the 
     PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and will be set to '1' to indicate that the CS
     order was entered via pharmacy backdoor and was not digitally signed.
  
 12. A new field, DIRECTIONS FOR USE (#120) is being added to the PENDING
     OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) to store the raw HEALTH LEVEL SEVEN
     (HL7) dosage data as sent from CPRS. This will be used to validate the
     integrity (hash count) against the CPRS digitally signed orders.
  
 13. Currently, the pending order screen displays only the number of 
     refills ordered by the provider. For digitally signed orders, this
     is modified to include the days supply and the quantity. Here is a
     screen capture:
     (6)    Issue Date: SEP 17,2012        (7) Fill Date: SEP 17,2012
     (8)    Days Supply: 45                (9)   QTY (  ): 45
    Provider ordered: days supply 45, quantity 45 & refills 1    
    (10)   # of Refills: 1                (11)  Routing: WINDOW
  
 14. The protocols PSO LM ACCEPT and PSO LM RENEW MENU are being modified
     to add code to the SCREEN field (#24) and the HEADER field (#26) of
     the PROTOCOL file (#101) to ensure users are limited to ListMan
     actions based on their security key.
  
 15. As part of this project, Kernel patch XU*8*580 introduced the 
     following new fields to the NEW PERSON file (#200). Apart from the 
     DEA#/VA# requirement, DEA further classifies what CS schedule a
     provider is authorized to write. 
  
     55.1      SCHEDULE II NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;1]
     55.2      SCHEDULE II NON-NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;2]
     55.3      SCHEDULE III NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;3]
     55.4      SCHEDULE III NON-NARCOTIC (S), [PS3;4]
     55.5      SCHEDULE IV (S), [PS3;5]
     55.6      SCHEDULE V (S), [PS3;6]
  
     If any one of the above fields are populated for a provider then when
     placing a new order in backdoor pharmacy, the software will now check
     for the drug schedule with the provider privileges. If the provider
     does not have the credentials to write such orders then the software
     will display a message (as shown below) and will not allow the 
     selection of that provider.
     Example: When the provider does not have schedule 2 privileges, this
     message is displayed: 
     "Provider not authorized to write Federal Schedule 2 prescriptions."
  
 16. When placing an order for a CS Detoxification drug, the software will 
     now check for a valid Detoxification number for the provider. If the 
     provider does not have a Detoxification number then the software will 
     display a message "Provider must have a DETOX# to order this drug."
  
 17. The Released and Unreleased Prescription Report [PSO RELEASE REPORT] 
     is being modified to include CS as a selection to the input. The drug
     name and CS schedule is being added to the output. Here are the
     changes:                         
  
 You are currently logged in under the CHEYENNE VAM&ROC division.
 Do you want to select a different division? NO// 
  
 Do you want ONLY Unreleased Prescriptions? NO// 
 Include (C)S Rx only, (N)on CS Rx only, or (B)oth (C/N/B): B// Controlled 
 Substances Rxs Only
  
 Select controlled substance schedules
  
      Select one of the following:
  
           1         SCHEDULES I - II
           2         SCHEDULES III - V
           3         SCHEDULES I - V
  
 Select Schedule(s): 3// 
  
 The report currently shows the count of unreleased and copay
 prescriptions, but not the count of released prescriptions. The report is
 modified with this patch to include the count of released prescriptions.
  
 18. The following options are being modified to include the
     DETOX/MAINTENANCE ID NUMBER field (#53.11) and the DEA EXPIRATION DATE
     field (#747.44) of the NEW PERSON file (#200) as part of the screen. 
     The DEA EXPIRATION DATE field will be prompted only if the PROVIDER
     TYPE field (#53.6) of the NEW PERSON file (#200) is marked as "FEE 
     BASIS".
  
     Add New Providers [PSO PROVIDER ADD]
     Edit Provider [PSO PROVIDER EDIT]
     View Provider [PSO PROVIDER INQUIRE]
  
 19. Currently, the default days supply for all drugs is set from the DAYS 
     SUPPLY field (#3) of the RX PATIENT STATUS file (#53) up to a maximum
     of 90. With this project, the default for CS schedule II-V drugs will
     be set to 30 or from the DAYS SUPPLY field (#3) of the RX PATIENT
     STATUS file (#53) if it is less than 30. Also, the Integration Control
     Registration #3278 that returns days supply (DSUP^PSOSIGDS) to CPRS is
     modified to return 30 or from the DAYS SUPPLY field (#3) of the RX
     PATIENT STATUS file (#53) if it is less than 30 for CS schedule II-V
     drugs.
  
 20. The pharmacy release slip portion of the Laser Label is being 
     modified to include the text "(DSIG)" or "(NOT DSIG)" after the
     patient's name to indicate that the prescription is digitally signed
     or not digitally signed.
  
 21. This patch addresses the issue reported in REMEDY ticket #595795, to
     ensure that when editing an orderable item/dispensed drug, the 
     instruction field is displayed only when editing the pending order 
     and not when editing an active or non-verified order.
  
 22. The Expire Prescriptions [PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS] option that 
     currently runs as a nightly job is being modified to check for the
     Institutional DEA 'expiration date'. If the expiration date is within
     30 calendar days or past expiration then a mail message will be
     generated and sent to PSDMGR key holders. Here is an example when the
     expiration date is within 30 days:
  
 Subj: 500:Institutional DEA Expiration Date is about to expire  [#140331]
 03/20/12@11:57  3 lines
 From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Please update Institutional DEA Certification Date. Will expire on 
 3/24/12.
  
 ******************************
  
 Here is an example when the DEA Expiration Date is past expiration date:
  
  
 Subj: 500:Institutional DEA Expiration Date has expired  [#140333]
 03/20/12@12:08  3 lines
 From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Please update Institutional DEA Certification Date. Expired on 2/19/12.
